Identify the fields in each data category which can be used for anomaly detection purpose.

Develop a set of primary statistical validation rules to detect outliers (e.g â€“ outlier detection through quartile analysis)

Develop a secondary set of statistical validation rules including cluster analysis and other appropriate methods in order to conduct in depth analysis to anomalies and to identify the consistency of portfolios across different products.
